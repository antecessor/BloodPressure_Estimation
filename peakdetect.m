%% function [R_i,R_amp,S_i,S_amp,T_i,T_amp]=peakdetect(ecg,fs,view)
%% Online Adaptive QRS detector
%% Description
% QRS detection
% Detects Q , R and S waves,T Waves
% Uses the state-machine logic to determine different peaks in an ECG
% signal. It has the ability to confront noise by canceling out the noise
% by high pass filtering and baseline wander by low pass. Besides, check
% out criterion to stop detection of spikes.
% The code is written in a way for future online implementation.
%% Inputs
% ecg : raw ecg vector
% fs : sampling frequency
% view : display span of the signal e.g. 8 seconds (8 seconds is the default)

%% Outputs
% indexes and amplitudes of R_i, R_amp, etc
% heart_rate computed heart rate
% buffer_plot : processed signal
%% how to use
% for example after loading the the ecg mat files in matlab call the
% function as below ;
% [R_i,R_amp,S_i,S_amp,T_i,T_amp]=peakdetect(EKG1,250,10);
